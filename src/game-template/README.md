# Game Template

This directory contains all **Game-Specific Implementation** code. When setting up for a new FRC season, this is the directory where almost all customization will happen. The `core` directory is the framework and should ideally remain untouched.

## Directory Structure

```
game-template/
├── components/          # UI Components customized for the game (e.g., specific selectors, charts)
├── analysis.ts          # Logic for defining stats, rates, and badges
├── constants.ts         # Scoring constants (point values)
├── scoring.ts           # Scoring calculation logic (functions to compute points)
├── strategy-config.ts   # Strategy Overview page configuration (columns, presets, aggregates)
├── transformation.ts    # Logic to transform raw match data into db-ready counters
```

## Key Files to Customize

### 1. Scoring Logic (`constants.ts` & `scoring.ts`)
Define the point values for Auto, Teleop, and Endgame in `constants.ts`. Implement the calculation functions in `scoring.ts` to determine the total points for a match entry.

### 2. Data Transformation (`transformation.ts`)
Maneuver uses a generic `ScoutingEntry`. This file defines how to take the raw array of actions (e.g., "Scored coral") recorded in the UI and turn them into counts in the database (e.g., `auto.coralCount = 5`).

### 3. Analysis & Display (`analysis.ts`)
Defines "Stat Cards" and "Rate Cards" for the Team Stats page. You define the *metadata* here (titles, labels, colors), and the UI will render them.

### 4. Strategy Configuration (`strategy-config.ts`)
Configures the **Strategy Overview** page with team statistics table and charts. This file defines:

- **`columns`**: Array of column configurations for the team stats table
  - `key`: Data path (e.g., `"auto.action1Count"`, `"totalPoints"`)
  - `label`: Display name shown in the table header
  - `category`: Grouping for the column settings sheet (e.g., "Auto", "Teleop", "Endgame")
  - `visible`: Whether the column is shown by default
  - `numeric`: Whether the column contains numeric data (enables filtering/sorting)
  - `percentage`: Whether to display as a percentage

- **`presets`**: Named column visibility presets (e.g., "essential", "auto-focused", "endgame")

- **`aggregates`**: Custom calculation functions for derived metrics like `totalPoints`, `autoPoints`, etc.

Example column definition:
```typescript
{ key: "auto.action1Count", label: "Auto Coral L4", category: "Auto", visible: true, numeric: true }
```

### 5. Components (`components/`)
Contains the React components that need to change year-over-year, such as:
*   **Field Selector**: For choosing auto start positions.
*   **Pit Questions**: For the specific pit scouting form.
*   **Scoring UI**: The buttons scout press during a match.
*   **Team Stats Tabs**: The graphs and charts shown on the analysis page.

See [components/README.md](./components/README.md) for details on customizing components.
